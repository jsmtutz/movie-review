# Movie Review App

> üçø A TMDB client built with Next.js 14

Welcome to the "movies" web app! This app allows you to search for movies, TV shows, or people by title and view their details, including overview, release date, and average rating. You can also watch movie trailers and browse popular movies, top-rated movies, upcoming movies, and now playing movies.

The app is built using Next.js, a React framework for building server-side rendered and static websites. It also utilizes Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. The Movie Database API is used to access a vast collection of movie and TV show data.

To get started with the app, follow the steps outlined in the "Getting Started" section of this README. Contributions are welcome, so if you have any ideas, suggestions, or bug reports, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy movie browsing!
